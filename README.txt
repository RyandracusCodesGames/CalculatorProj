THERE ARE A FEW QURIKS WITH MY IMPLEMENTATION OF A CALCULATOR.

	QUIRK 1: CALCULATOR ONLY SUPPORTS TWO OPERANDS AND A SINGLE OPERATOR PER CALCULATION
	         IF YOU WISH TO DO MORE, MUST EQUAL CURRENT OPERATION TO EMPLOY ANOTHER
			 
    QUIRK 2: MUST CLICK EQUAL TO GET CURRENT RESULT AND PROGRESS TO NEXT OPERATION
	
	QUIRK 3: USE W AND S KEYS IN WINDOWS WHILE IN TRACE LOGIC TAB TO SCROLL THROUGH THE DECISIONS
	
	QUIRK 4: THIS MAY BE STANDARD, BUT IF YOU ONLY PROVIDE ON INPUT AND AN OPERATOR, YOUR CURRENT
	INPUT WILL TURN INTO THE RESULT TO AVOID ANY ERRORS.
	
	QUIRK 4: ALL GRAPHICS DATA IS SOFTWARE RENDERED, SO I IMPLEMENTED A MINI IMAGE, INPUT, AND DRAWING
	LIBRARY, BUT I AM AWARE OF SOME OF THE MORE USEFUL GDI FUNCTIONS FOR WIN32 PROGRAMMING.
